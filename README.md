VanillaDesk is not just a simple notepad. It’s a hybrid workspace that combines an **advanced WYSIWYG word processor** with a powerful **in-memory Relational Database Engine (RDBMS)**.

Everything runs at lightning speed, entirely in your browser. No servers, no clouds, no subscriptions, no dependencies (Zero NPM, No React/Vue/Angular). Just pure, solid, and blazingly fast **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## Why I Built VanillaDesk
Working as an IT professional in **AMS (Application Management Services)**, I constantly found myself managing repetitive tasks, log queries, code snippets, and fragmented documentation. I needed a tool as fast as a notepad but as powerful as a relational database, one that I could run on corporate machines without installing servers or relying on external Clouds blocked by strict firewalls. That’s how VanillaDesk was born.

## Key Features

* **100% Privacy & Local-First:** Your data never leaves your computer. The app saves everything into a local folder (Workspace) on your hard drive using the native *File System Access API*.
* **Native Relational Databases:** Turn raw data into Kanban Boards, Calendars, or Gantt Charts (Timelines) with a few clicks. Supports inter-table Relations, Rollups, and Formulas.
* **Automation Engine & Macros:** Create Triggers and Actions. Fire chain updates, trigger sound alerts, or modify hundreds of records in batch via custom programmable buttons.
* **Sandboxed JS Formulas:** A computation engine that allows you to write pure JavaScript code inside cells for complex math, string manipulation, and dynamic styling.
* **Transclusion (Live Citations):** Dynamically embed a text block or a table from another note. Edit the original, and all citations across your entire workspace update in real-time.
* **Military-Grade Encryption:** Protect your data with native WebCrypto API AES-GCM 256-bit encryption. Set a password, and the JSON saved on your disk becomes completely unreadable.
* **Crash Recovery System:** With every keystroke, the app performs a silent backup in IndexedDB. If your browser crashes or the tab is accidentally closed, your session is restored instantly.

## Architecture & Tech Stack
The engineering goal behind VanillaDesk is absolute longevity and zero technical debt from third-party frameworks.
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, ES6+ Vanilla JavaScript. Custom Virtual DOM and Caret Engine for Widgets.
* **Storage:** File System Access API (Disk Persistence) + IndexedDB (RAM Cache & Crash Recovery).
* **External Libraries:** The only external dependency is `Chart.js` (bundled locally in the repo) used to generate Analytic Dashboards and Pivot Charts.

## AI-Assisted Development (Pair-Programming)
To build this project, I adopted a modern AI-assisted development approach. The software architecture, business logic, in-memory database design, and overall UX are the result of my own vision and AMS background. LLM models acted as my "Co-Pilots" to accelerate boilerplate coding, optimize sorting/filtering algorithms, and refine the Vanilla CSS UI, always operating under strict, pre-defined architectural rules.

## How to Use (Zero Installation)
The application is a true serverless Single Page Application (SPA).
1. Clone or download the source code from this repository.
2. Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your browser.
3. Click on **"Create New Workspace"** to initialize your working folder on your PC.

⚠️ **Browser Compatibility:** Since VanillaDesk heavily relies on the modern *File System Access API* to physically write files to your hard drive, a Chromium-based browser is required (**Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera**). Browsers like Safari or Firefox do not yet fully support these APIs natively.
